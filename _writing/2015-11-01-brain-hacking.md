Abstraction allowed computing to become ubiquitous and transformative. By
abstraction, I mean the characteristic that a user of a computer can interact
with the highest layer of a computer and have their interaction translated into
a language the processor can understand without understanding the nature of
the transformations that happen in between. As a conscious being, I interact
with my brain in a similar way. I think thoughts and send non-verbal commands
which translate into physical actions. I want to figure out a better way to
communicate commands to my brain.

While the combination of language and imagery serve me fine for many tasks, I
feel that both put bottlenecks on the brain's massively parallel architecture.
This becomes painfully obvious when we think about the complexity of routine,
habitual tasks. For example, throwing and catching a ball is an immensely
complex dynamics problem. Getting a computer to model the ball's motion, its
hands motion, and the effect of wind on the ball's motion has taken years of
brilliant engineers' time. Humans on the other hand, can seemingly learn to do
this sort of thing with a few days of practice.

This example illustrates that we neglect how powerful our brains currently are.
My brain should be able to emulate any computation, given sufficient time and
resources. So why can't I compute floating point operations out to 10
significant digits or sort 100000 element arrays as quickly as a poorly written
version of bubble sort? This is the question I aim to answer and the problem I
aim to solve.

I view two examples of human brain capabilities as pointers or hints to the
direction which I need to pursue in order to unlock my brain's capabilities:
memory palaces and anzan. Memory palaces utilize the spatial capacities of the
brain to store large amounts of information. Anzan players visualize an abacus,
and, by doing so, are able to compute arithmetic more quickly than a calculator
in some cases. 

- Leads
    - the Nam-Shub neal stephenson
        - If only this were real, it would be the ultimate primary source.
    - Anzan players and Memory palaces
        - both use imagery to better utilize certain built-in capacities of the
            brain. In this area, I'd be happy with either of two solutions. The
            first would use a more general imagery tool that could compile
            instructions and directly send them to the brain stem. Or a tool
            that would be specific for controlling body stuff (an imaged voodoo
            doll perhaps?). Although the second wouldn't make me any better at
            coding, it would at least allow me to start playing around with bio
            mods.

        - I'm skeptical of this area, as the only areas I've seen it are tulpa
            owners and "magicians", two groups which I'm loathe to trust and
            interact with. Furthermore, the study about multitasking
            definitively showed that tulpas do not provide a boost in this area.
            The only reason I'm even interested in this area is Jaynes' work
            about agents in the brain. That being said, I think I should table
            this area for now. It just doesn't seem like the most viable option.
- Open Questions
    - need to figure out what the bytecode of the brain is (nam-shub)
    - why can advanced yogis control these functions? what's the scientific
            explanation for the subtle / energy body that swami rama talked
            about? Is it electromagnetic in nature or quantum? what's the
            fastest way to get from knowing nothing about this to controlling
            it? Is it imagery or is it something on a lower semantic level? This
            could explain why mantra meditation seems to work so well since
            mantra meditation seems to zero out the brain's registers.
    - is there a form of language that will allow us to bypass the usual
        language interface (Snow Crash)?
- Sources to read
    - Dune
    - Snow Crash
    - Swami Rama
        - The stuff I've read by the swami is also frustratingly vague. The man
            could blossom tumors on his skin at will, but never seemed to reveal
            the path to being able to do this. For my purposes, Rama is more of
            a proof-of-concept than a viable source for learning unfortunately.
    - Imagery sources
        - unfortunately, I have trouble finding useful sources for imagery
            practices. Practitioners tend to fall into 1 of two groups:
            buddhists or alternative medicine gurus. Neither group documents
            their results in a way that I can derive much useful information
            about the efficacy of different practices. These groups tend to
            focus on spiritual rather than physiological outcomes.
    - Cognitive Science ?
        - Linguistics could be as useful. Something like Chomsky's universal
            grammar could maybe point to a more low-level language for
            communicating with the brain. That being said, I think programming
            provides an as or more useful analogue for this stuff (but I'm
            biased).
