# Mind and Brain

into mainstream psychiatry. Recounts the effects of
psychedelic treatment on patients suffering from addiction or
nearing the end of their lives.

# Biographical
[Meet Walter Pitts, The Man Who Tried to Redeem the World With Logic](http://nautil.us/issue/21/information/the-man-who-tried-to-redeem-the-world-with-logic)  
Profiles Walter Pitts, a mathematician who worked alongside
the founders of modern information theory but eventually suffered a
crippling breakdown.

[The Outside Game](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/outside-game)  
Interviews and discusses the work of Howard Becker, a sociologist famous
for studying deviants and their cultures. I'm not usually
interested in sociology, but I found Becker's perspective on cultures
and their essential elements fascinating.

# Vaccination
[Measles: Misinformation Gone Viral](http://www.hoover.org/research/measles-misinformation-gone-viral)  
Argues for a rational approach to vaccination. I felt that reading this
article gave me a more well-rounded view of the ongoing vaccination
debate than the ongoing banter between politicians. I hope that's
true for you too.

# Education
[Latin Lives](http://www.thenation.com/article/196177/latin-lives)  
Profiles the Paideia Institute, a school reviving the study of Latin
as a living language. Ties in well with current discussions surrounding
the value of the humanities, but, at times the author preaches more than
he describes.

# Personal Data

Discusses the future of the resume in broad terms and then showcases
the author's prototype of a futuristic resume.
