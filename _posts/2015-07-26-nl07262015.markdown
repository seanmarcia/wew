## Other Contributions
[Hackers Remotely Kill a Jeep on the Highway -- With me in it](http://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/) (Scott Gladstone)  Scott said, "The fact that Jeep/Chrysler could push a car through development and testing to full-scale production with such an outrageous hack is pretty ridiculous and terrifying."

On my end, I especially enjoyed the discussion of the thought processes that went into these guys’ hack.

[Charity Navigator 3.0: The Empirical Empire's Death Star?](http://nonprofitquarterly.org/2013/04/05/charity-navigator-3-0-the-empirical-empire-s-death-star/) (Will Baird)  
Baird offered this article as a counter to last week's article about Effective Altruism.  Baird described the articles as follows, "I thought this was a very good counter-point to the idea that all charitable donations should be driven by empiricism."

[Self-Aware Robot Solves Riddle](http://news.discovery.com/tech/robotics/self-aware-robot-solves-riddle-150724.htm#mkcpgn=rssnws1) (Leslie Cofer)  
Discusses a robot that managed to solve a riddle that only humans have solved previously. This is a fascinating testament to the continuous advancement of computational intelligence.

[One Company's New Wage: $70,000 a Year](http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/business/owner-of-gravity-payments-a-credit-card-processor-is-setting-a-new-minimum-wage-70000-a-year.html?_r=0) (Mark Malina)  
Examines the CEO of Gravity Payment's decision to set a minimum wage of $70,000 for the entire company.  I'm incredibly impressed by this CEO's boldness and willingness to challenge organizational assumptions. I can only hope that more executives will experiment with their organizations in the future, not only with their wages, but with all aspects of their organizations.
