# Philosophy
[Do Easy](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/do-easy-william-s-burroughs-and-gus-van-sant-show-you-how-to-get-things-done)  
The film and source essay (linked to at the bottom of the page) both
convey a philosophy rooted in Taoism, but understandable for the modern
American. It's important to note that William S. Burroughs (the essay's
author and the author of <a

addiction for much of his life.  Looking at this essay in light of that,
I found that many of the ideas took on a dual meaning.

# Mastery

strange fascination with tales of mastery.

NPR reports on a community in Austin, Texas that's been founded upon
principles of sustainability and community.

# Journalism and International News

National Geographic interviews Lynsey Addario, a war-photographer who
has photographed the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars. Her discussion sheds
light on changes around the world as the well as the mindset required to
endure the fear and hardship associated with photographing war.

# Agriculture
[The Amish Farmer Replacing Pesticides with Nutrition](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/10/the-amish-farmer-replacing-pesticides-with-nutrition/380825/)  
This article reports on an early adoptee of John Kempf's methods for
increasing farm yields. In case you don't remember, I included an
article on Kempf in a previous newsletter (found 
[here](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CCAQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fmodernfarmer.com%2F2014%2F08%2Fbrilliant-unusual-twenty-something-hopes-unleash-next-green-revolution%2F&ei=HeHgVO6FBM_nsAS2zYIg&usg=AFQjCNFYbfnLWQyYf2AHeDgbl44Qr3PfqA&sig2=xe1Lh6eJqOpsYdSb6e0lSw&bvm=bv.85970519,d.cWc)).
I'm so interested in these modern farming techniques because they take
into account the systemic nature of the farm ecosystem, and reflect a
larger movement towards systems-level thinking in the sciences.

[If I Die on Mars](https://vimeo.com/119124588) (Will Baird)  
This short video profiles three of the several hundred people Mars One is considering for a one-way mission to the red planet. It gives some insight into the strange, diverse, and even heartbreaking worldviews and experiences that could motivate such a mission. The video illustrates how the motives of someone who would choose to die on Mars are, in the end, incredibly human.
