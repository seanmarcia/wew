# Books
[Rapt](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/09/rapt)  
Reviews [H is for Hawk](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802123414/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0802123414&linkCode=as2&tag=stepmali-20&linkId=CJ2ENMPESPZRPOIR), a non-fiction book about grief, hawking, and T.H. White. Discusses grief and the quirkiness of hawks and hawking.

# Memory
[Memory in the Flesh](http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/18/8225321/memory-research-flatworm-cannibalism-james-mcconnell-michael-levin)  
Explores research on the radical idea that memory can exist outside the brain in other parts of the body. This article's interesting because it shows how political science can be. I'm always drawn to articles which challenge scientific dogma as I think innovation often arises from these challenges.

# Addiction
[The Irrationality of Alcoholics Anonymous](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/03/the-irrationality-of-alcoholics-anonymous/386255/)  
Argues that the one-size-fits-all prescription of Alcoholics Anonymous and the 12 step program is harmful. I found this article quite convincing. Reading this also reminded me of the book [The Power of Habit](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/081298160X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=081298160X&linkCode=as2&tag=stepmali-20&linkId=UC2PKJP7UMKFESGL) which discusses the mechanisms behind both harmful and helpful habits.

# Prehistory
[First Artists](http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2015/01/first-artists/walter-text)  
Discusses cave paintings' importance in prehistoric culture. Does a good job of emphasizing the importance of symbols to our own culture.

# Human Capabilities
[The Iceman Commeth](http://www.scottcarney.com/article/the-iceman-commeth/)  
Profiles "Iceman" Wim Hof. Carney, the author of the piece, recently wrote a book all about spirituality and gurus gone wrong so it was fascinating to see his take on Hof. I want to state outright that I'm biased towards trusting this author's claims.

[The Impossible Physiology of the Free Diver](http://m.nautil.us/issue/22/slow/the-impossible-physiology-of-the-free-diver)  
Discusses free diving and the physiological mechanisms that make it possible to hold ones breath for as long as expert free divers do.

# Other Contributions
[In College and Hiding From Scary Ideas](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/opinion/sunday/judith-shulevitz-hiding-from-scary-ideas.html?ref=opinion&_r=0) (Will Baird)  
Discusses the extension of childhood. Focuses on how it relates to social justice in particular.

[Inside the Deep Web Drug Lab](https://medium.com/backchannel/inside-the-deep-web-drug-lab-9718cd0fe504) (Will Baird)  
This is an awesome piece on a Spanish lab that tests drugs people buy from places like the Silk Road. The lab's existence, and the enthusiasm of both drug users and merchants for its services, testifies to the power of the free market to strive for consumer safety even in sectors where people expect safety least. This could be a glimpse of a freer and more technologically advanced future.
