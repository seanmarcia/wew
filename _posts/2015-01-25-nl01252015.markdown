# Human Potential
[Natural Born Heroes](http://www.outsideonline.com/fitness/agility-and-balance/natural-born-heroes/Parkour-Fitness-Program.html)  
Sometimes, when I read an article, I think it would be great for the
newsletter because it calls into question a widely-held belief or
delves deep into an esoteric topic in a profound way. This isn't one
of those articles -- this is an article that you read and think
"this is awesome." The article covers a few different groups reviving or
creating new uses of the human form.

[A circus of the senses](http://aeon.co/magazine/psychology/are-we-all-born-with-synaesthesia/)  
Surveys scientific studies on synaesthesia. Argues that
synaesthetic abilities exist on a spectrum rather than as a binary.

# Future of the Economy
[This Twenty-Something Hopes to Unleash the Next Green Revolution](http://modernfarmer.com/2014/08/brilliant-unusual-twenty-something-hopes-unleash-next-green-revolution/)  
Profiles John Kempf, a mid-twenties Amish farmer, Kempf, who favors a results-based
approach to agriculture which synthesizes modern
and traditional farming techniques. This article stood out to me because
Kempf's techniques don't require farmers to abandon GMOs or
reduce their yields. Kempf, instead, forgoes the rhetoric of the organic
farming movement in exchange for a more pragmatic approach. This quote
exemplifies why Kempf deserves the praise he's receiving:

  > “I was taken seriously,” Kempf says, “because I was able to ask
  > really intelligent questions and I didn’t tell anyone how old I
  > was.”

[Small is Bountiful](http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/small-bountiful-small-business-craft-beer)  
Argues that small businesses can exploit large corporations' blind spots
in order to find their niche. Paints an optimistic picture of our
economy as a dynamic entity. This article contrasts
[last week's article](http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/180431/american-entrepreneurship-dead-alive.aspx),
which convincingly argued that entrepreneurship (as opposed to
innovation) is on the decline in the United States. Unfortunately,
last week's article makes a more compelling case, utilizing a more
rigorous statistical approach. That being said, this article
shows how, in certain sectors, small businesses' are growing and
thriving.

[Debate: McDouble, Cheap and Nutritious?](http://freakonomics.com/2013/07/11/a-burger-a-day-a-new-marketplace-podcast/)  
Summarizes a debate over whether McDonald's McDouble is a good low-cost food
option.

# Technology
[Where Cellular Networks Don't Exist, People Are Building Their Own](http://www.wired.com/2015/01/diy-cellular-phone-networks-mexico/)  
Profiles Rhizomatica's work to bring cellular networks to rural villages
in Mexico. I view this project as a prime example of an effective aid
program.

[Will online anonymity win out?](http://aeon.co/magazine/technology/will-online-anonymity-win-out/)  
Questions whether internet activists will win their fight for total
online anonymity. Proposes that online anonymity should be preserved in
most cases. Although I take a harder stance on the rights of internet
users than this author, I thought he did a good job of conveying both
sides of the argument and discussing their relative merits.

# History
[The Gay Capital of the Nineteenth Century](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/berlin-story)  
Reviews the gay rights movement that began in late 1800s Berlin. I
enjoyed this piece because it covers German history without falling
victim to the trap of portraying everything before Nazism as
connected to its rise.

# Foreign Policy
[How Isis Rules](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2015/feb/05/how-isis-rules/)  
Provides an inside look at life under the rule of ISIS. This is the most
comprehensive article on ISIS I've found so far.

# Perception
[Spot the Sniper](http://www.slate.com/blogs/behold/2015/01/20/simon_menner_camouflage_is_a_conceptual_look_at_snipers_in_germany_photos.html)  
Displays panorama images that contain camouflaged snipers. The challenge
is to spot the sniper in the image. While I mostly included this because
I think it's fun, I also enjoyed the comparison made
between these images and Apple advertisements.
