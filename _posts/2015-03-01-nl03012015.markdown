# Science and Technology
[Futures of Text](http://whoo.ps/2015/02/23/futures-of-text)  
A survey of all the current innovation in text as a medium. Argues for the superiority of text-based communication and interaction over app-based communication and interaction.

[First human head transplant could happen in two years](http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22530103.700-first-human-head-transplant-could-happen-in-two-years.html#.VPMkfFPF9U4)  
Discusses the prospects for transplanting a human head onto another body. Neglects to discuss from where the second body would come, but, otherwise does a good job of explaining the idea and the issues surrounding it.

[The Secret Science of Novak Djokovic's Training Pod](http://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/science/Will-the-CVAC-Pod-Change-the-Way-Athletes-Train.html)  
Examines the CVAC pod, claimed to improve athlete performance, and profiles its founders. Despite the gimmicky title, this article displays an impressive level of nuance. I included it because it denies the reader an easy answer to the question it poses.

# Education
[Your Kid’s School Is Missing the Tech Revolution, and It’s All Your Fault](http://www.wired.com/2015/02/kids-school-missing-tech-revolution-fault/)  
Attempts to explain why so many educational technology startups fail. Characterizes the different viewpoints of young tech executives and nervous parents well.

# Neuroscience
[The Elastic Brain](http://aeon.co/magazine/psychology/can-i-make-my-brain-as-plastic-as-a-childs/)  
Investigates the possibility of a 'brain plasticity pill', which, if created, could restore the learning abilities of a child's brain to an adult one. Exciting stuff.

# Software
[What A Rembrandt Can Teach you about Software and Programmers](http://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2015/02/rembrandt-software-programmers/)  
I'll admit this article's a bit self-indulgent. It pulls an excerpt from a book I intend to read -- <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/019507906X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=019507906X&linkCode=as2&tag=stepmali-20&linkId=6UKYMC2ORXI2CDHY">Mirror Worlds: or the Day Software Puts the Universe in a Shoebox...How It Will Happen and What It Will Mean</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=stepmali-20&l=as2&o=1&a=019507906X" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
-- that elegantly distills the essence of software development.

# Other Contributions
[What Kind of Man joins the Men's Rights movement?](http://www.gq.com/news-politics/big-issues/201503/mens-rights-activism-the-red-pill) (Don Casler)  
Profiles the Men's Rights movement and it's de facto leader, Elam. This article falls into a category of articles for which I lack a name but can identify quickly. Such articles use the guise of outsider-ness to cloak their bias. In this case, the author clearly had a pre-formed view of the Men's rights movement. Don't get me wrong, I'm not particularly sympathetic to this movement, but I did feel like the article portrayed the movement as unreasonably single-minded.

[The Atheist Paradox](http://aeon.co/magazine/philosophy/adam-roberts-atheist-christianity/) (Mark Malina)  
A philosophical investigation of Atheism and it's relationship to Christianity and belief in general.

[The Age of Uncertainty](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/398625/age-uncertainty-kevin-d-williamson) (Will Baird)  
Questions the wisdom of our society's collective embrace of delayed adulthood, spearheaded by the higher education system.
