## The Blockchain
[Blockchains in Context](http://bit.ly/1Wcrtsp)  
An easy to understand article about blockchains by a core
contributor to Ethereum. Ethereum aims to create an understandable,
general-purpose system for creating and enforcing contracts on the web.
Potential applications of this system are more varied than you might initially
expect. [This picture](http://i.imgur.com/mh7b0Vy.png) breaks down areas in
which Ethereum could prove an effective tool.

## Medicine and Biology
[Can we end the war on Cancer?](http://bit.ly/1Gy87w4)  
The author of this piece answers the title question with an optimistic outlook.
Argues that the primary barriers to defeating cancer are institutional, not
scientific.

[Biologists Discover Bacteria Communicate Like Neurons in the
Brain](http://tinyurl.com/nry8ypk)  
Compares a bacterial colony's communication network dynamics to that of the human
brain's. While the authors seem to be interested in using this to kill bacteria,
I'm interested in exploiting this to control bacteria. I imagine using a
programming interface to generate electrical signals that manipulate bacteria to
do all sorts of interesting tasks.


## Business
[Reinventing the Company](http://bit.ly/1MMR4Dk)  
An interesting take on the the future of public and private companies.
Unfortunately, I don't understand this area of the market
particularly well. I'd like to rectify that, however. If you have thoughts on
this article or the trends it predicts, I'd love to hear them.
