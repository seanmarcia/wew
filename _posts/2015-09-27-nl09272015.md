## Neuroscience and Neurotech
[Hypnosis reaches the parts brain scans and neurosurgery cannot](http://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2010/sep/30/hypnosis-neuroscience-psychology)  
A good, succint article about the use of hypnosis in real neuroscience. Makes me hope I'm in the 10% of people who are highly suggestible.

[Playing 20 Questions with the Mind](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0137303)  
Summarizes a new study in which two individuals in isolation played 20 questions using a brain-to-brain interface. This is a big first step towards more usable brain-to-brain interfaces. I dream of the day when two people can put on headsets and communicate with each other at the speed of thought.

[Apex: Nexus Arc Book 3](http://amazon.com/dp/B00K4BA758/?tag=stepmali-20)  
I just finished Apex, the third in a series of books about the emergence of a new technology that allows individuals to interface with each other through a direct brain-to-brain connection. This series, starting with [Nexus](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0857665502/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0857665502&linkCode=as2&tag=stepmali-20&linkId=PZQCTNQRDRUAHV6S), provides a convincing portrayal of the effect near-future technology can have on global society. I’m including a link to this book because I think it goes well with the two articles about brain-computer-interfaces.

[Paraplegic man walks with own legs again](http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/sep/24/paraplegic-man-walks-with-own-legs-again)  
A man who was paralyzed from the waist down walks again thanks to brain-to-computer technology. While this system has a long way to go before it is ready for the consumer market, this demo shows the potential of the technology.


## Design
[The Bourne Aesthetic](http://exple.tive.org/blarg/2015/09/20/bourne-aesthetic/)  
A discussion of Jason Bourne versus James Bond and how that relates to Apple’s disregard for longevity and maintainability. This is a ramble for sure but I enjoyed the writing style and agree with the author's conclusions. The highlight of this piece is definitely this passage:

>"If you’re already rolling out your “resigned disappointment” face: believe me, I totally understand. I suspect we’ve both dealt with That Guy Who Calls Himself A Designer at some point, that particular strain of self-aggrandizing flake who’s parlayed a youth full of disdain for people who just don’t understand them into a career full of evidence they don’t understand anyone else. "

## War
[The Art of Influence](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-ff9a9c01-faa4-4038-b4e9-83e619460e1f)  
A retired general discusses the techniques he employed in the mission to take Musa Qala, Afghanistan.

## Other Contributions
[Living in a Code Yellow World](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/09/living_in_a_cod.html) (Will Baird)  
Bruce Schneier, one of my favorite Computer Security figures, discusses the dangers of always being "on alert".
