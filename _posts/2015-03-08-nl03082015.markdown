# Mental Health
[The voices in my head: Eleanor Longden's 'psychic civil war'](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/08/ted-talk-eleanor-longden-schizophrenia)  
The Guardian interviews Elanor Longden, a woman who started hearing voices while in college. Longden discusses her ordeal and subsequent recovery, shedding light on the nature of her disease. One of the commenters on this article wrote a thoughtful comment, which I've included

  >"It makes me wonder that we all have these voices to some degree, but that it's rarer to have them be so articulate, so able to enunciate distinct aspects of our personalities. More commonly, I wonder that most of us experienced our 'voices' as something more akin to shapeless feelings and emotions (worry, depression, anxiety, contentedness, silliness). Maybe many of us can keep from hearing and actually acting on these voices in helpful ways because they are so shapeless and subdued, but that's to our detriment, perhaps."
